/**
 * Debugging purposes only.<br>
 * NOTE: FOR USAGE IN THE COMPETITION:<br>
 * Just copy the packages you want to use into each project; The judges compile the code themselves, 
 * and in order to make it as easy and intuitive as possible for them we should keep it all together. 
 * From what I can tell, each "package" is a folder (according to windows). Should be best just to 
 * preserve that structure and keep that in the root directory of the flash drive. Worst case scenerio, 
 * we just copy paste snips of code into the project's main class... But depending on the function 
 * being used, that might take up an unneccesarily large amount of time.
